# albaretto

**A DALL·E 2 image generation downloader. Permits easy upload to cloud services like Google Drive.**

Status: an afternoon project. Don't expect robust capabilities!

## Usage

```shell
$ albaretto <openai-bearer-token> google-drive <credentials.json>
# perform OAuth 2.0 authentication with a web browser

[albaretto] [google-drive] > fetch <task-id>
  ✓ Fetched <image-generation-id-1> (356.89 KiB)
  ✓ Fetched <image-generation-id-2> (340.39 KiB)
  ✓ Fetched <image-generation-id-3> (279.75 KiB)
  ✓ Fetched <image-generation-id-4> (401.94 KiB)

[albaretto] [google-drive] > save <folder-id>
  ✓ Saved <image-generation-id-1>.webp to <folder-id>
  ✓ Saved <image-generation-id-2>.webp to <folder-id>
  ✓ Saved <image-generation-id-3>.webp to <folder-id>
  ✓ Saved <image-generation-id-4>.webp to <folder-id>

# only fetch generated images 2 and 3 (one-indexed from left to right as displayed in the UI)
[albaretto] [google-drive] > fetch <task-id> -g 2 -g 3
  ✓ Fetched <image-generation-id-2> (340.39 KiB)
  ✓ Fetched <image-generation-id-3> (279.75 KiB)
```

The above workflow is the same for saving to the local filesystem, i.e.

```shell
$ albaretto <openai-bearer-token> local-filesystem

[albaretto] [local-filesystem] > fetch <task-id>
...

[albaretto] [local-filesystem] > save /path/to/output/directory
...
```

$ python -m pip install .

## Authentication

### OpenAI's DALL·E 2

Prerequisite: must have access to OpenAI's DALL·E 2 

1. Navigate to (and possibly log into) https://labs.openai.com/.
2. Open *Developer Tools* in your web browser and navigate to the *Network* tab.
3. On https://labs.openai.com/, type a prompt and click "Generate".
4. Look for request to https://labs.openai.com/api/labs/tasks.
5. Look for authorization in the request header. The bearer token will begin with `sess-`.
6. Copy the bearer token.

### Google Drive

## Limitations

As far as I know, there is no way to pipe `|` or push `>` data through Typer or Click commands.

Ideally, the command line interface would work like this:

```shell
$ albaretto <openai-bearer-token> google-drive <credentials.json>

# where `save` takes arguments folder-id and a list of files
[albaretto] [google-drive] > fetch <task-id> | save <folder-id>
```

But I don't know of a way to achieve the above. Instead, the `fetch` command saves output into the `typer.Context`, whence the data is retreived by `save`.

This program **does not** provide full nor robust UNIX-like utilities for interacting with OpenAI's DALL·E 2 or Google Drive.

## Why . . . ?

**Why does this program exist?** I found it tedious to save and then re-upload the images generated by OpenAI's DALL·E 2 using the user interface.

**Why is it named `albaretto`?** Doctors Giuseppe and Mara Albaretto were patrons and collectors of Salvador Dalí's work.
